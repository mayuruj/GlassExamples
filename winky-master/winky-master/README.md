winky
===========

A way to enable the wink gesture on Google Glass to take a photo.

- The screen can be off while you wink, this means completely hands and mouth free photo taking. Take pictures while you eat!
- Run the app, then use the touchpad to tap on the calibrate. Follow the on screen directions to calibrate.

So why do we need this app?
There's at least one location in code on Glass that does a check to see if the wink gesture should be enabled and then turns it off if it shouldn't. This turns on the wink gesture, and makes sure that Glass won't be able to disable it by intercepting any future wink gestures and responding with a photo.
